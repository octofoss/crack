# Corru Radical Automatic Character Kit
A modification helper/builder for [corru.observer](https://corru.observer) with intuitive GUIs to help make every part of the process easier.
- An alpha build version of this site can be found [here.](crack-118.pages.dev)

### Notice
This repo has been made public after realizing this might never be an actual thing.
  - Most of what you find in this README is a vision of what it could be. The only thing that presently exists is a front page with 5 options and absolutely 0 functionality. It just looks pretty.
  - Feel free to expand upon it on your own!

### Usage
1. Open the site.
2. Click in the top left, and create a new project.
3. Select whichever editor you need -- most people would start with entities.
4. Mod?
